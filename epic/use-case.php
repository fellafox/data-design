		<h1>Use-Case</h1>
		<main>
<p>Use Story: a wild Max makes a search on the site with the intention of favoriting a specific item(s), clicks on a product and favorites it.
</p>
			<p>Use Case: Max likes logging in on his macbook pro or his iphone 6 to favorite items for later. He makes decent money and doesn't always have the cash right away though so that is why he tends to favorite quite a few items. He really likes natural bath products and also loves his cat. He has an unlimited data plan and likes to take his time perusing the internet.</p>
